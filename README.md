**Iâ€™m a computer engineer currently working in the defense industry.** I have a mixed background in both software and hardware engineering. I like building things. I spent the beginning of my engineering journey focused on designing and programming embedded systems. Currently, I am slowly making a shift to dive deeper into the software engineering world. I am trying to teach myself more high-level programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**In addition to engineering, I also have a passion for mentoring and teaching.** I want to be an inspiration to the black female engineers that come after me. My goal is to always leave a meaningful mark on anything that passes through my hands.
